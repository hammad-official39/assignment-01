            <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                     The history of Pakistan is marked by its ancient civilizations, notably the Indus Valley, followed by the arrival of Islam in the 7th century and the establishment of the
                     Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire, which fostered cultural and economic prosperity. Under British colonial rule from the mid-19th century, the demand for Muslim representation 
                     grew, leading to the Lahore Resolution in 1940 and the eventual creation of Pakistan on August 14, 1947, as a separate state for Muslims in South Asia. The early years were fraught
                     with political instability and challenges, including mass migrations due to partition, followed by cycles of military and civilian governance. Today, Pakistan navigates complex social,
                     economic, and political landscapes while continuing to assert its identity in a dynamic region.
